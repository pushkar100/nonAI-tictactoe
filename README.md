# nonAI-tictactoe

A simple TIC TAC TOE game written in Javascript.

It does not use any AI or ML techniques such as the MiniMax Theorem.
Instead, it uses a basic algorithm that takes care of all cases.

The `tic-tac-toe.js` file contains actual logic for the computer player.

In order to play on the browser, the project includes some css styles and html markup.
Download and open `test.html` to play against the computer.
